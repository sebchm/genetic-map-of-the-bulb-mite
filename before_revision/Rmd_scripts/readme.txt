R markdown scripts used to analyze the genetic map

1) mapAnalysis_plottingFig1.Rmd 
  * summarize all chromosomal maps, calculates summary statistics for each chromosome
  * plotting Fig. 1

2) correlation_and_distribution_genomic_features.Rmd
  * calculate the fraction of 2 Mb windows covered by genes, repeats and GC content
  * calculate Pearson's correlation coefficients between recombination frequency and genomic factors mentioned above
  * plotting Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig S8. 
  * calculate the distribution of the genomic factors along chromosomes
  * test the difference between gene and repeat density between autosomes and sex chromosome
